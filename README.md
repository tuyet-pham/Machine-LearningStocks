### Abstract
The main goal is to create a consistent and reliable algorithm that will give us a relatively close prediction of a stock’s, or stock(s)’, value at the end of each quarter. From the prediction we can then set to buy or to sell. Although the amount gained will depend, the algorithm must result in an overall net positive gain for those that use it. The subsequent goals for our team are to successfully and correctly implement the Random Forest Regression algorithm and to understand the internal steps that the algorithm takes to come up with the prediction for our stock prices. 
Our team strongly feels that Random Forest Regression Stock Predictor is a great and challenging learning opportunity for both Machine learning Integration and Stock Market trends. The stock market is a very volatile playing field. Finance professionals deemed a player’s success rate as 75 percent skills and 25 percent luck. As a group we collectively understand the volatility and accept the challenge to understand more. Not only is the project itself challenging, stock market prediction algorithms are highly useful for personal and professional use, therefore this is something we can all take away from to use and improve on in the future.
