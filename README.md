Random Forest Regression Stock Predictor
====
> Group 3 : Jon Wallis, Tuyet Pham, Caleb Halter, Kyle Petrie

### Abstract
The main goal is to create a consistent and reliable algorithm that will give us a relatively close prediction of a stock’s, or stock(s)’, value at the end of each quarter. From the prediction we can then set to buy or to sell. Although the amount gained will depend, the algorithm must result in an overall net positive gain for those that use it. The subsequent goals for our team are to successfully and correctly implement the Random Forest Regression algorithm and to understand the internal steps that the algorithm takes to come up with the prediction for our stock prices.
